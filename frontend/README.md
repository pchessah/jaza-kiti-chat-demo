- **Tailwind CSS:** Clean, modern, and responsive design.
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for failed submissions or sends.
- **Loading & Success States:** Visual feedback for loading and successful actions.
- **Component Modularity:** Reusable, well-structured components.

## How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open in browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage
- Enter your email to start a chat session.
- Send messages in the chat window. Messages are sent to the backend, stored in Supabase, and AI responses are generated by Gemini.
- Loading, error, and success states are displayed with glassmorphism overlays for a modern user experience.

## Notes
- The frontend expects the backend to be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default (see `src/services/chatService.ts`).
